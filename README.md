## Description
Assignment submission number 4 in the UOB Front-End Web Development Bootcamp.

For this assignment, we learnt some basic javaScript syntax and functions which were put to the test during this assignment. 

I added what was supposed to appear in the console.log into the HTML file just as a visual reference. 

## Challenges
There were definitely some arithmetic equations which i wasnt able to get working and broke my code, which i will need to revisit in the future.
